A Relational Non-SQL Database

## What?

There's a lot of buzz in the new millenium about NoSQL and Non-relational databases.  CosmicDB aims to implement a relational non-SQL database, comprised of the typical JSON representable hashes, lists and values, but also supports constraints for data types, and foreign keys for referencial integrity!

## Why?

ComsicDB will appease inexperienced programmers with its schemas that translate directly to your business logic, and it will appease seasoned programmers by offering the best (and worst if desired) of both worlds of JSON-like NoSQL systems and the traditional tabular relational database.

## How?

Let's take a look at some desires and conceptual samples to acheive them.

### Sample Data:
```
Users = [
	{
		email: 'duder23@example.com',
		name: 'Duderino',
		pass: 'wam bam bam', 
	},
	{
		email: 'jose@example.com',
		name: 'Jose',
		pass: 'meep meep'
	}
]
```

## When?

Not yet.  Hopefully by 2015.
